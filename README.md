## About the Project

Breast cancer is one of the second deadliest cancers after lung cancer, where cases are often found throughout the world. The causes of breast cancer are very diverse, including family history, obesity, hormones, radiation therapy, and even reproductive factors. If the problem was late being detected within a few months, it can lead to the formation of large numbers of erroneous cells that are detected as cancer (Amrane et al., 2018). <br>
Given the importance of early detection of breast cancer, a system is needed to predict and detect the possibility of breast cancer. While machine learning is known for its advantages compared to classical prediction method, unfortunately most of the researchs were not paying much attention to imbalance dataset. <br>
The aim of this research was to implement Borderline Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to balance the breast cancer dataset, and then use the balanced data for building the breast cancer prediction models. The prediction model will be trained using the balanced dataset, and in this research Random Forest Algorithm gave us the best accuracy and F1 score result. We then deployed the best model into website using Streamlit.
